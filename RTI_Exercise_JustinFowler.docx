RTI Exercise

This is a brief summary of my attempt at this exercise, and a mention of what would be done with more time.
For this exercise, I began by opening the provided SQLite database. Through a series of queries (one for each additional table in the database), I combined the ‘results’ table with the other tables in the database. The resulting table (named ‘results_flat’) was exported as a csv file from SQLite.
I imported results_flat.csv into RStudio for exploration and analysis. I began by producing many table to understand the data. Of particular note, the education_level and education_num variables are 100% correlated, providing the exact same information. Therefore, I chose not to use education_num for any analysis. Also, looking at capital_gain and capital_loss crossed with over_50k, there is a lot of separation. Therefore, these variables would not be appropriate for a logistic regression model (at least not without some adjustment). Using R’s glm function with the family=”binomial” option, I created a logistic regression model to predict over_50k. I used all other variables except education_num, capital_gain, and capital_loss, for reasons described above. A brief look at the variable coefficients suggests most of them were significant at a 0.05 significance level. However, a stricter cutoff should be used, and more analysis should be applied to selecting appropriate variables. Finally, after obtaining a model, I produced a ROC graph. The area under the curve was about 0.88.
Given more time and/or familiarity with R, there are many other aspects to consider in the above analysis. These include: handling missing values, checking for interactions, checking model assumptions, performing variable selection techniques, and observing type III analysis of effects. I would also want to partition the data into training, validation, and testing sets, and perform many more diagnostics on the model.
